# FOOD RECOMMENDATIONS

## HUT MEALS

Most rifugi provide half-board (breakfast and dinner) options. Lunches usually
need to be purchased separately or brought with you.

## TRAIL SNACKS & LUNCH IDEAS

- Energy/protein bars
- Trail mix and dried fruits
- Hard cheese (keeps well without refrigeration)
- Cured meats like speck (local specialty)
- Crackers or flatbreads
- Dark chocolate
- Electrolyte tablets or powders
- Energy gels for quick boosts

## WATER

- 1 water bottle and shared dromedary
- Water purification tablets or pump (most rifugi have potable water, but some
  sources along the trail may need treatment)

## FINAL TIPS

- Pack as light as possible; you'll be carrying everything between huts
- Layer clothing for changing mountain conditions
- Book rifugi in advance, especially if traveling on weekends
- Consider purchasing a Sentres or Tabacco map for your specific route
- Check weather forecasts daily - conditions can change rapidly

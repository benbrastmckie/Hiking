# DOLOMITES HUT-TO-HUT BACKPACKING: GEAR & FOOD GUIDE

## IMPORTANT SEASONAL NOTE

The period from May 30 to June 3 is very early season in the Dolomites. Many
mountain huts (rifugi) may not yet be open, and higher trails could still have
snow. I recommend checking operational status of all huts before finalizing
your itinerary.

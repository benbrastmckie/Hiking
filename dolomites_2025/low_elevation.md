I am looking to put together a backpacking trip from hut-to-hut from May 30 to June 3th in a lower elevation area in the Italian Alps. Can you outline a few potential hiking trip loops with between 6 and 12 miles of hiking a day, at least one easy peak to climb, and staying at some of most beautiful huts?
